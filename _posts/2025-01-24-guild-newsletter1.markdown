We have many guilds within the Empire of the Imperial Magistracy. One such guild, the Guild of Invocation, produces an annual newsletter showcasing works from its members. This is the newsletter for 1595 (2024).

## What is the Guild of Invocation?

The Guild of Invocation is for those who seek creativity, and it shall be a symbol of strength, knowledge, and learning for all those who reside in the Empire of the Imperial Magistracy. It was inspired by the belief of Ancient Greeks, who thought that through the recitation of their works, they could invoke inspiration and protection from the great muses of mythology. The purpose of the Guild of Invocation is the education of the Empire of the Imperial Magistracy through the research and recreation of various Renaissance crafts and skills. The guild strives to inspire the pursuit of creativity and craftsmanship in any and all forms.
